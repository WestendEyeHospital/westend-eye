      Its the best eye hospital in Cochin. My father's cataract operation for both the eyes were done here. Dr David Akkarra is very knowledgeable, experienced and friendly. The hospital promise look very small - however the equipments are modern and they have flawless procedure which are so quick. Staffs are cordial too. Highly recommended!!ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
