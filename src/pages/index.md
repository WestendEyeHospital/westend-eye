        Cataract is the opacification of the natural lens of the human eye. It can happen in many people in old age. It happens faster in some of us due to diabetes, injuries or other conditions. The good news is that cataracts can now be safely removed through a tiny incision and a transparent artificial lens can be placed to bring your vision back to normal or even better.

        The Cornea is the outermost clear part of the eye. Many injuries and even infections can happen on the cornea. If you are injured by a small stone, stick or metal piece; immediate eye examination with a slitlamp microscope and some stains can show the area and severity of the injuries. These have to be treated early and monitored carefully to fix the damaged cornea.

        Glaucoma is an eye disease where the optic nerve of the eye is damaged, most often by high eye pressure. Tests like Fundus Photography, OCT and HFA are done to diagnose and measure the damage due to glaucoma. It is then treated by eyedrops, LASER or surgery depending on many factors. It is very important for family members of those with glaucoma to get tested for glaucoma.

        Retina is the image sensor of the camera that is the human eye. The light focused by the lens falls on the retina and is converted into "bio-electrical" signals that are transmitted to the brain. Diabetes and hypertension are two common systemic diseases that affect the retina along with others. There are also other diseases like ARMD, Retinal detchment, macular hole, CSR and so on.
